                    <p>Hi! We're researchers from University College London (UCL), UK. We've done goofed and we've forgotten all of the prime numbers! That's right! All of them. Rather than admit this embarrassing oversight, we've decided to ask you, the kind people of Facebook, to help us re-calculate them all. It's a total nightmare and really not something you would expect from a university of our renown. It's almost like this is fictitious research, designed to show only the bare minimum of the potential of this rather spiffing Facebook App.</p>

                    <p>Here's what we do. We give you a huge number and your browser runs through a set of instructions in order to work out if the number is prime or not. Some numbers are easy (one's that divide by 10 for instance), some are hard (you try dividing 193823876239878 into prime factors!). You'll see some updating stats as the task progresses and when you come up with a result you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that you've done research!</p>

                    <p>Thanks for helping us out! You're great, just click the link below to participate.</p>
